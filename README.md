Title: Exploring Word Embeddings and Clustering in Data Science: Analysis of Job Listings and Descriptions Dataset

Abstract:

This data science project centers on the investigation of word embeddings through clustering methodologies, utilizing a dataset comprising job listings paired with their corresponding descriptions. The primary objective is to employ  techniques in natural language processing(word2vec) to uncover meaningful patterns and insights within the given dataset. The project emphasizes the application of clustering algorithms to organize and categorize textual information, contributing to a more profound understanding of the relationships between job listings and their associated descriptions.
